          <h1>BLACK HOLES, WHAT ARE THEY ?</h1>
          <img src="assets/images/black_hole.jpg" alt="one image black hole" />
          <p>
            A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so intense
            that nothing, not even light, can escape. According to Einstein's
            theory of general relativity, a sufficiently compact mass can create
            a black hole by distorting spacetime. The boundary marking the point
            of no return is called the event horizon. Despite their immense
            influence on nearby objects, black holes lack any discernible
            features according to general relativity and resemble ideal black
            bodies that emit no light.

            A star, a luminous plasma sphere, is held by self-gravity. The
            closest star, our Sun, shines upon Earth. Other stars, seen as fixed
            lights due to vast distances, populate the night sky. Prominent ones
            form constellations; some bear proper names. Astronomers catalog
            them, identifying and standardizing stellar designations. An
            estimated 10^22 to 10^24 stars fill the observable universe, with
            about 4,000 visible to the naked eye within the Milky Way.

            A comet is a small icy body in the Solar System that releases gases
            when it approaches the Sun, a process known as outgassing. This
            creates a coma, an extended atmosphere, and sometimes a tail of gas
            and dust blown out from the coma. These effects are caused by solar
            radiation and the solar wind plasma interacting with the comet's
            nucleus

          <p>
            Anime is hand-drawn and computer-generated animation originating
            from Japan. Outside Japan and in English, anime refers specifically
            to animation produced in Japan.However, in Japan and Japanese, anime
            (a term derived from a shortening of the English word animation)
            describes all animated works, regardless of style or origin. Many
            works of animation with a similar style to Japanese animation are
            also produced outside Japan. Video games sometimes also feature
            themes and art styles that can be considered as "anime".

          <p>
            Manga are comics or graphic novels originating from Japan. Most
            manga conform to a style developed in Japan in the late 19th
            century, and the form has a long history in earlier Japanese art.The
            term manga is used in Japan to refer to both comics and cartooning.
            Outside of Japan, the word is typically used to refer to comics
            originally published in the country.
